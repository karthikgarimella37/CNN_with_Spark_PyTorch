# CNN using Spark and PyTorch

Using Spark and PyTorch, we perform classification of Pneumonia Chest X-ray among COVID-19 patients using CNN.

## Problems intended to be solved:
+ The main idea of this project is to leverage CNN to recognise specific patterns in Pneumonia patients.
+ The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) presents several unique features for Pneumonia patients. CNNâ€™s image recognition capabilities can be used on the chest X-rays of patients to determine if the patient has Pneumonia.
+ A deep learning model is developed to identify pneumonia patterns on X-rays of COVID-19 patients. Spark will be used for big image data analysis in a distributed environment.


## Data

+ The data is taken from: [Kaggle Covid19 Xray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets/data)

+ The dataset was created by Joseph Paul Cohen and Paul Morrison and Lan Dao. COVID-19 image data collection, arXiv, 2020. https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.

## Data Split
The data is split into Train and Test by default, in an approximate 80-20 split. The response variable is perfectly balanced.

Sample size: 188 images
Train Frequency: 74 True and 74 False
Test Frequency: 20 True and 20 False

## Data Augmentation

+ Resizing some of the images
+ CenterCrop images to create sets focused on the center of the image
+ Normalized the images to improve pixel density.
